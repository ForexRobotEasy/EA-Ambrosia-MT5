## Description

EA Ambrosia MT5 is a powerful forex trading expert advisor that combines advanced technical analysis tools and trading strategies to make profitable trades in the forex market. It is designed to work on the MetaTrader 5 platform and can be used on any currency pair.

The EA uses the Central Pivot Tool and Institutional Levels Indicator to calculate pivot and Fibonacci levels based on the previous day's price action. These levels are then displayed on the chart, providing valuable information for making trading decisions.

The EA also monitors institutional levels to identify significant trading levels. It checks if the current price is above or below these levels and provides comments accordingly.

Based on the selected entry options and combinations, the EA executes trades using the Trade module. It places buy orders with specified lot size and entry option.

To manage risk, the EA sets stop-loss and take-profit levels based on the institutional levels. It modifies the stop-loss and take-profit orders for open trades accordingly.

The code is optimized for performance and resource usage to ensure efficient execution. It is also thoroughly tested for accuracy and reliability to ensure consistent and profitable trading.
